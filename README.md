## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fungamer2-2/Life-Simulator1.git
   ```
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Usage

Run [lifesim.py](lifesim.py) script:
```sh
python3 lifesim.py
```

## Translating

`lifesim.pot` is a template for translations. <br />
Copy `lifesim.pot` to a new file, fill in the translations, then upload it as `lifesim.po` in the `locale` folder.<br />
The `.po` should be placed in the directory path `locale/[language code]/LC_MESSAGES`. <br />
I will then convert it to a `.mo` file so it can be translated.
